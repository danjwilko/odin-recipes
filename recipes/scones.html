        <h3>Ingrediants</h3>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>350g self-raising flour, plus more for dusting</li>
                <li>1tsp baking powder</li>
                <li>85g of butter, cut into cubes</li>
                <li>3 tbsp caster sugar</li>
                <li>15ml milk</li>
                <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
                <li>squeexe of lemon juice</li>
                <li>beaten egg, to glaze</li>

            </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>Heat the oven to 220C/200C fan/gas 7. Tip the self-raising
                    flour into a large bowl with Â¼ tsp salt and the baking
                    powder, then mix.</li>
                <li>Add the butter, then rub in with your fingers until the mix
                    looks like fine crumbs. Stir in the caster sugar.</li>
                <li>Put the milk into a jug and heat in the microwave for about
                    30 secs until warm, but not hot. Add the vanilla extract and
                    a squeeze of lemon juice, then set aside for a moment.</li>
                <li>Put a baking tray in the oven. Make a well in the dry mix,
                    then add the liquid and combine it quickly with a cutlery
                    knife, it will seem pretty wet at first.</li>
                <li>Scatter some flour onto the work surface and tip the dough
                    out. Dredge the dough and your hands with a little more
                    flour, then fold the dough over 2-3 times until it's a
                    little smoother. Pat into a round about 4cm deep. Take a 5cm
                    cutter (smooth-edged cutters tend to cut more cleanly,
                    giving a better rise) and dip it into some flour. Plunge
                    into the dough, then repeat until you have four scones. You
                    may need to press what's left of the dough back into a round
                    to cut out another four.</li>
                <li>Brush the tops with a beaten egg, then carefully arrange on
                    the hot baking tray. Bake for 10 mins until risen and golden
                    on the top. Eat just warm or cold on the day of baking,
                    generously topped with jam and clotted cream. If freezing,
                    freeze once cool. Defrost, then put in a low oven (about
                    160C/140C fan/gas 3) for a few minutes to refresh.</li>
